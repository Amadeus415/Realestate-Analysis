# Real Estate Linear Regression - Kaggle Data Science Competition

## Project Overview

This project is part of a Kaggle Data Science competition focused on predicting real estate prices using a linear regression model. The dataset used includes various features such as property size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes to estimate property values. The goal is to build an accurate model that can predict house prices based on the given features.

## File Structure

- **analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire workflow for the linear regression model, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The notebook is organized into the following sections:
  - **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial inspection of the dataset, including summary statistics and visualizations.
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may improve model performance.
  - **Model Training**: Building and training the linear regression model using the processed data.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ².
  - **Prediction**: Generating predictions for the test dataset and preparing the submission file for the competition.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

These libraries can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

**Set up a virtual requirement(Optional), and ensure Python is installed

**Install the dependecies**: With virtual environment activated


    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
